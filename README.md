# COSC102-tutorial-1

Pretty basic questions but... I have trouble with question 5, cumulative sum of the first row?
I don't know why I can't figure that out.

As well as the fib sequence took me like 2hrs... made me feel very stupid.

Still have question 7 todo, will finish it tomorrow if I can finish the java tut im still halfway through.... 

Im gettting real busy already

Two day later update.

I was either to tired or thinking to hard
Finished these questions this afternoon fairly easily
I need to rememeber that 
a - I know python fairly decently
b - dont forget this is just python
c - seriously... its just python...

I let my brain start thinking its meant to be data science, then I realise I dont know what that is... blah blah blah.
